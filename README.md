## 1  Making Changes to the Repository
Work in your designated branch. Designated branches are named after your name. When you want to submit major changes to the master branch, create a `Pull Request` from your branch into the `master` branch.

## 2  Development Environment Requirements
- Node.js
- IDE, Coding Text Editor (Sublime, VS Code, Atom are good)
- GitHub Desktop (Using Git on commandline works too)
- Your favorite browser
- PATIENCE!!!!! :D

### Setting up Node.js
1. Head to `https://nodejs.org/en/`
2. Download the current version. As of writing the version is `10.11.0`. Newer versions are fine. Don't download LTS
3. Follow installation prompts. Use default values

## TODO
- Describe workflow for making changes more clearly
